		<p>There is a lot we can do to help preserve and repair this world, for us, our kids, the animals and most importantly, our future. At the rate we are going right now, we will have just a couple of centuries left before most, if not all of our resources are depleted, gone, kaput.</p><br>
		<p>Where will that leave the human race, the animals, fish, birds and yes, even the insects? No home, no future, no life. Are we going to sit by and let the planet be consumed by our lust for more, and more, and more? Or are we going to get smart about the damage we have caused, and educate everyone about the damage being done to our environment and the impact on the wildlife? </p>

		<p>The wildlife of this planet is what insures that we survive. The animals eat other animals to maintain a balance. The insects also play a role, they provide a food source, they help keep other insect populations in check, and some insects even provide means for us to stay healthy.</p><br>
		<p>I feel that we are on a downward spiral to oblivion if we continue on the path that we are on. We need to pay more attention to the impact that we are creating on the wildlife everywhere.</p>
